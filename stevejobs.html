      <h1>TRIBUTES</h1>
      <p>"Remembering you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose," Steve Jobs told Stanford's graduating class of 2005 in a stirring commencement speech. "You are already naked; there is no reason not to follow your heart." The man who founded Apple, revolutionized personal computing, turned Pixar into an animated-film-making behemoth, and forever changed the music and cell phone industries with iTunes, the iPod, and the iPhone, died on Wednesday at age 56, after a seven-year battle with pancreatic cancer. Admirers worldwide mourned the loss at Apple Stores, Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and online — using the very computers, iPhones, and iPads that Jobs developed and proudly unveiled over the years. Here, a sampling of tributes to the tech visionary:</p>
      <h2>Friends and Family</h2>
      <p>Steve died peacefully today surrounded by his family. In his public life, Steve was known as a visionary; in his private life, he cherished his family.
         Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who met Jobs in the early 1970s:<br>
         It's like there's a big hole left in you, and it's very hard to go back and reflect on all the feelings. ... Everyone knows what he did — how much life he brought to the world. I think if he had a goal, he certainly far, far overachieved any goals he had from the start of things.
         I think Steve Jobs would have had hopes and visions for the future, and he set up Apple Computer really to continue on in his dreams. And I hope that Apple always finds great leaders like him. He made a lot of people happy. How many times can you remember products from a company that just made you happy every time you used them?
      <h2>Business partners and rivals</h2>
      <p>Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, who had a legendary, heated rivalry with Jobs:<br>
        Steve and I first met nearly 30 years ago, and have been colleagues, competitors, and friends over the course of more than half our lives. The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come. 
        For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it's been an insanely great honor. I will miss Steve immensely.<br>
        Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, where Jobs was a board member and top shareholder after Disney bought Pixar in 2006:<br>
        Steve was such an "original," with a thoroughly creative, imaginative mind that defined an era. Despite all he accomplished, it feels like he was just getting started. With his passing the world has lost a rare original, Disney has lost a member of our family, and I have lost a great friend.
        Google co-founder Sergey Brin:
        From the earliest days of Google, whenever [Google co-founder] Larry [Page] and I sought inspiration for vision and leadership, we needed to look no farther than Cupertino. Steve, your passion for excellence is felt by anyone who has ever touched an Apple product (including the MacBook I am writing this on right now).</p>
      </p>
      <h2>Politicians</h2>
      <p>President Obama, who earlier this week said he got his iPad 2 from Jobs himself, "a little bit early":
         Steve was among the greatest of American innovators — brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it. ... The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented.<br>
         New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg:<br>
         America lost a genius who will be remembered with Edison and Einstein, and whose ideas will shape the world for generations to come. Again and again over the last four decades, Steve Jobs saw the future and brought it to life long before most people could even see the horizon.
         Former Sen. Chris Dodd, now head of the Motion Picture Association of America:<br>
         The genius of Steve Jobs, a man I've known for 40 years, not only brought to life the visual magic and brilliant storytelling of Pixar, but brought the world one of the most innovative and successful platforms to make movies and TV. ... If anyone ever wonders whether one person can make a difference, the answer is Steve Jobs. He will be deeply, deeply missed.
